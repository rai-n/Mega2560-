MPU-6050 module which is one of the best IMU
(Inertia Measurement Unit) sensors, compatible with Arduino. IMU sensors like the MPU-6050
are used in self balancing robots, UAVs, smart phones, etc.

The InvenSense MPU-6050 sensor contains a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyro in a single chip.
It is very accurate, as it contains 16-bits analog to digital conversion hardware for each channel.
Therefore it captures the x, y, and z channel at the same time. The sensor uses the I2C-bus to
interface with the Arduino.
